Engineer Muhammad Ali Mirza, born on October 4, 1977, in Jhelum, Punjab, Pakistan, embarked on a public journey that transitioned from a mechanical engineering career to a prominent, albeit controversial, role as an Islamic scholar. After earning his mechanical engineering degree from the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila [1, 2], Mirza served as a mechanical engineer for the Government of Punjab. His increasing public engagements as a religious figure eventually led to his resignation from his engineering post when his department requested his departure [2]. This pivotal decision laid the groundwork for his public persona as a religious intellectual.

Mirza quickly established himself as a renowned Islamic scholar and speaker, primarily through online lectures and a research academy focused on the Quran and Sunnah [2, 3]. A key aspect of his approach, which has both garnered followers and sparked debate, is his ability to simplify complex Islamic concepts, coupled with a strong emphasis on critical thinking, rationality, and evidence in understanding Islam [3]. This intellectual stance, while appealing to many, has also positioned him at odds with traditionalist interpretations within contemporary Muslim discourse [7].

Operating within Pakistan's complex legal and social landscape, where differing schools of Islamic thought and the application of Sharia law can lead to significant legal and social ramifications, Mirza's willingness to challenge established narratives has generated considerable controversy [8, 11]. For instance, his interpretation of a prophecy, suggesting Prophet Muhammad referred to Mu’awiya as "a wicked man," directly conflicts with the reverence held for Mu’awiya by the majority Sunni Muslims in Pakistan, who consider him a companion of the Prophet [3, 8]. Such interpretations are not merely academic; they carry severe risks, potentially leading to accusations of offending religious sentiments, which in Pakistan can result in arrest and lengthy jail sentences, ranging from ten years to life [6, 8]. Fundamentalist elements, who view Mirza as "too liberal," may leverage these controversies to silence him [8]. Further accusations against Mirza include deliberately distorting Islamic tawhid to imply that certain forms of shirk (polytheism) might not constitute kufr (disbelief) [9]. These theological positions highlight a broader tension between traditional interpretations and more liberal or reformist readings within Islam.

Mirza's journey has been fraught with significant challenges and controversies that have profoundly shaped his public image. He has faced multiple assassination attempts, surviving incidents in October 2017, March 2021, and August 2023, often involving attackers armed with knives at his academy [2]. Furthermore, he has been arrested on several occasions, including in May 2020 on suspicion of hate speech and in August 2025 (likely a typo for 2023 or 2024) under public order ordinances [2]. Most notably, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) has declared him guilty of blasphemy, and he has been charged under Pakistan's blasphemy law for allegedly outraging religious feelings and making derogatory remarks [2, 4]. His controversial views, such as those on Mu'awiya I and even claims of supporting atheists against Muslim debaters, have further fueled the debates surrounding him [2, 5]. Despite the intense scrutiny, opposition, and legal pressures, Mirza maintains a following, with students actively disseminating what they consider authentic Islamic teachings based on his methodology [10]. This dynamic illustrates the ongoing evolution and contestation of Islamic thought in the modern era.

This report has detailed his transition, highlighting his emphasis on critical thinking and evidence in understanding the Quran and Sunnah. We explored the severe challenges he faces, including multiple assassination attempts, arrests, and blasphemy charges, stemming from his interpretations.
